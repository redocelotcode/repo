# The recocelot hackcamp repo for website and database code

Todo: (everything)

- Build basic home page
- Create simple footer and header - mvc template without bootstrap 5?
- Add github login functionality? - robbed idea from shaun
- retrieve filtered database resu.ts for code complexity
- edit README to add or complete todo's

- get charts up - we have filters for db results and such
- once charts are up we can make a dropdown graphic for selection
- then focus on frontend - make it look nice
